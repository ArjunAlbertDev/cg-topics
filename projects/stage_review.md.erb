#### Preparation
* Prepare a presentation for your project
* About 10-15 slides, explaining your product and businesds (so far)
* A draft or preview of your final presentation
* I realize that there are still a few weeks to go, so there will be unanswered questions and gaps

#### Meeting format
* 45 minutes
* Prepare 30 minutes, but we will go 45 to allow for questions and discussion)
* You should be ready to "present" your presentation
* I will give you my best advice on how to make your best possible final deliverables.

This is what I will be considering:

1. Preparation for the meeting
