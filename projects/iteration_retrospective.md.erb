## Definition

For our purposes an Team Retrospective is a short writeup your current status at this iteration or stage.

### Contents

  * What did our team complete this iteration or stage
  * What do we hope to complete next iteration or stage
  * Issues and blockers or stage
* Links to key deliverables that are due, for example the url to your google drive or other documents.

*As an aside, these questions are known as "the three questions" and are inspired by and mentioned in a lot of the Agile literature. For example see: [Daily Scrum Meeting](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/daily-scrum)*
