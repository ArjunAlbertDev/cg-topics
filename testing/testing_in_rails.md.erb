title: Testing in Rails

### Testing in Rails
* Principle is the same
* Remember there's no good reason to test whether Rails is doing what it is supposed to do
* For example, whether validations are validating, or whether has_many is actually working
    * Maybe a few tests to poke some holes, but certainly not each and every test.
* Rails gives you "for free"
  * A test/ directory that includes:
    * Folders to hold tests for each part of your application
    * Folders for storing YAML fixture data (test/fixtures/) and other types of data files (test/fixtures/files)
    * A test helper file (test/test_helper.rb) that you'll use to configure your testing stack and runs
  * Generators that will spit out assert-style unit tests for any Rails components you create
  * Configuration for a test database in config/database.yml
  * A way to run your test suite or subsets of it with the rails executable (Rails 5+) or rake (previous versions)
  * A complete, pre-tuned test environment configuration
  * The Spring application preloader that speeds up tests and Rake task execution in your development and testing environments by keeping an instance of your application running in a background process (installed by default in Rails 4.1 and up)‚Äù
