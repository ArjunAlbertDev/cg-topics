## Test Driven Development
* One of the central ideas from Agile Software Methodology
* But it has been applied too dogmatically
* All your code should be covered by tests
* But not all of it needs to be developed via test-driven-development

### What is it?
* It is always done with as an extension to automated testing
* Core idea: write the tests before you write the code
* **Sounds counter-intuitive!**
	* Allows you to think of making your API clean before you worry about how to implement it
	* Allows you to build up your functionality with confidence of a solid foundation
	* Prepares you to be able to introduce refactoring with confidence

### Money Demo
* Goal: A Money class
	* represent money in different currencies
	* What are all the operations you would want to do with them?
	* As a client how do you want to call them?
	* Discuss with a neighbor how you would write the test
