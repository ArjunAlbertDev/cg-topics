title: Test Data

## Test data and seeds
* Intro
  * Data or objects that exist exclusively for testing
  * Sometimes known as test or seed data
  * Also known as 'fixtures'
  * What is the role of data in developing tests for your application
* Where are they stored?
  * in memory (i.e. objects and classes)
  * on disk (i.e. files, images, ...)
  * in a database (i.e. records in a dbms)
* When are they created?
  * At "build" time, i.e. putting files in the right directories or adding records to an empty database
  * At "launch" time, i.e. when the app launches it creates the fixtures
  * At "test run time", i.e just  before the test needs them
* Tooling
  * In rails, we have "seeds" and "fixtures" built in
  * In sinatra, just seeds
* Mocks
    * Let's look at some of the code that runs this web site.
    * Note slightly different syntax because of RSpec vs. minitest/spec
    * [citem_spec.rb](https://github.com/pitosalas/coursegen/blob/master/spec/citem_spec.rb)
    * [toc_spec.rb](https://github.com/pitosalas/coursegen/blob/master/spec/toc_spec.rb)
