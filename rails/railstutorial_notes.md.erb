desc: Important modifications and updates tothe Rails Tutorial
---
#### Versions
* Ruby 2.6.5
* Rails 6.0

#### Development Environment
* **RECOMENDATION** Don't use Cloud9, Eclipse or Idea: The book suggests using the Cloud9 environment. I have not used it so I cannot vouch for it. I know that when you get to your project you will not be using it. You should use the command line.
* **RECOMENDATION** I recommend Visual Studio Code, [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com). You can also use Atom or Sublime as your text editor: There are other ones, particularly on Windows. Whatever you use, it needs to be simple text editor that reads and writes simple "ascii" files. I recommend Atom.
* **RECOMMENDATION** Don't use **RVM**. Instead use **Rbenv**.
* **RECOMMENDATION** Use Bootstrap version 4
