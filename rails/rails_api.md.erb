title: Rails API
---
## Rails API Only apps
* Realize that you can have multiple apps accessing the same databases!
* You can have a Rails app for your views and controllers, and a different app for your API
* The "automatically created" REST APIs in Rails are "questionnable"
* Client side frameworks (e.g. React etc) put all the UI in the client
* Introducing: rails new foo --api-only

## But why use Rails in that case?
* Alternatives: Sinatra, Express, etc etc
* Nothing wrong with a hybrid configuration
* Isn't Rails overkill?
  * development, test, production modes
  * Really good security protection
  * "Reloading" -- really nice for developer
  * Logging is built in
  * routes.rb
  * Really deep caching
  * on and on
  * Finally: Why learn another framework?
* Why not just use Rails in the usual way?
  * That would be fine
  * Unless youre conserned about memory footprint etc
  * Or your sene of aesthetics is offended (why have all this stuff I never use?)

## Using Rails API
<%= ruby_begin %>
rails new my_api --api
<%= ruby_end %>
