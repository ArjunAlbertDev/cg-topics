title: "PA: Wall Follower"
desc: "Robot looks for nearest wall follows it"
---
### Purpose
Write ROS code that allows your robot to follow a wall or perimeter. You are free to refer to hints for inspiration, and are encouraged to experiment with novel ideas. Write ROS code to have the robot find a wall, drive up to .5 meters of it, then turn and start following it at that distance.

### References
- link to bashrc configuration and ssh troubleshoot
- link to instruction write a launch file
- link to chmod +x the python scripts and `catkin_make`

### Expected preparation


### Knowledge you will gain
* `/scan` Topic
* `/cmd_vel` Topic
* `PID` processing

### ROS message types
- [sensor_msgs/LaserScan Message](http://docs.ros.org/melodic/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/LaserScan.html)
- [geometry_msgs/Twist.msg](http://docs.ros.org/melodic/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/LaserScan.html)

### What I hope you will learn
* working with and processing Lidar data
* processing with and filtering sensor noise
* using math (especially geometry) to solve real world robotics problems
* How to use PID processing to make the robot behave reasonably
* Simple state management to control the behavior of the robot

### Deliverables
- source code in a .zip folder
- an informal video of the robot following the wall
  
### Tasks
- write the wall_follower.py
- write a launch file for your program
- test it on the actual robot

### Hints
- the robot should be able to detect which side the wall is located
- the robot should always aim to run at some fixed distance in parallel with the wall
- consider when the robot would need to turn, there are multiple cases.
- beware of invalid data from the lidar
