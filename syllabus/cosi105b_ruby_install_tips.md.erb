#### Software Installation

You will find dozens of articles and posts telling you how to install Ruby on your computer. Use them at your own risk. Here are the ones I need you to follow!

1. For MacOS Users, I strongly recommend installing [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/). It will make it really easy to install other tools you need.
1. Install the [Ruby Environment Manager](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) (**NOT rvm**). Follow the instructions for your platform. It is a solid and reliable package that will assist you in installing Ruby.
1. Using Rbenv, install Ruby 2.7.0: `rbenv install 2.7.0`
1. Install Postgres, version 10 or later. There are [installers for all platforms](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
1. Install the program [`git`](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) if you don't have it set up yet
1. Create an account on [`github`](https://github.com/) if you don't have one yet: 

#### Tips for Windows Users
If you are on Mac or Linux you should have no problems. If you are on Windows, you might have some problems. I believe the options right now are:

1. Spend $40 for 128Gig externale SSD, format it as a bootable Linux drive and boot of that. It's pretty easy and very reliable
1. Use VMWare to create a virtual machine on your Windows computer. If your computer is powerful enough and has enough disk and memory this is probably ok.
1. I have not tried this but: [RubyInstaller for Windows](https://rubyinstaller.org/) has a lot of famous developers behind it.
1. I have not tried this but: [Windows Subsystem for Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) has been reported to be a workable solution.
