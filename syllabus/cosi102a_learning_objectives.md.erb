### Learning Goals

1. **The Lean Startup:** A specific set of concepts, framework, theory and methodology to be applied to sort through product-market-fit, to help the entrepreneur steer the early work on a path to commercial success. While the Lean Startup framework is not the only one around, it is at present well respected among the computing related startup community. Not all students think of themselves as Entrepreneurs. The experience of this course will allow them to get a better sense of this and experience in a way what it would be like to pursue this direction.
1. **Entrepreneurship:** While this is not a business course per se, there are a number of foundational concepts that every technical co-founder and software entrepreneur needs to be familiar with. We will cover the basics of finance, product pricing, venture capital and funding.
1. **On the ground experience:** Central to the way this course works is that all students will be applying what they learn directly to the validation of a real product. In fact they will do this twice. Once, quickly, working on a specific product idea we supply. And then we will go through the whole lean startup process a second time, more gradually, on a product or business concept of their own devising.
1. **Project and Team Work:** No matter what direction a student ends up pursuing, we believe that the great majority of worthy endeavors are the result of team's collaboration. Therefore we put a high value on being successful working on a team for a major product. Teams invariably experience challenges in setting and agreeing on goals, making and meeting mutual commitments, accepting team members' diversity of interest, talent, motivation. These will all be occasions for learning and improving students success.
