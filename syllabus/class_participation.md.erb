title: Class Participation
---

Attendance is required either in person or on zoom. On zoom you will need to have your camera on to be considered in attendance. Also look for you to engage in discussions, both with the class and in breakout rooms. Also to make good faith efforts to respond to assignments marked as "participation" by submitting responses.
