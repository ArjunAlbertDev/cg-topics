* **Make your statement of the problem as compelling as you can**:  Here are a couple of examples: *"Museums have a big problem capturing the experience of their big important exhibits for posterity. The reason this is a problem is that .... We wanted to build a product that would allow a beautiful online experience of the exhibit that happened in the past that museums could use as an archive and historical record. In doing that we discovered that our idea would work well even for individual artists to display their work in a "virtual museum. Our product xxx does that by xxxx and xxx. Let us give you a demo" or "People who love doing non-solitary sports (basket ball, frisbee, running) can sometimes have a hard time finding partners for occasional game. It's a real pain when you want to go on a run or bike ride and and don't want to go alone. We looked at that and thought we could do something about it. Our product xxx is a simple xxx specifically designed for yyy and it allows ..."*

* **When you are showing or talking about something interesting, take a moment to explain it and help the listener appreciate it.**: Feel free to get a little geeky. Remember the judges are technical and will appreciate your engineering. Even though you feel rushed try to be clear. It might be the how elegantly your UI uses Ajax to be very responsive; it might be an interesting 3D color histogram which opens up certain cool possibilities.

* **Take the time to generate Seed data that looks somewhat real.** Focusing of course on the part of the product you plan to demonstrate, it makes your presentation and demo 10x more compelling if the data is real and interesting. And then when you show the product take a moment to explain what they are seeing on the screen. "Over here every tile corresponds to an assignment, and the color tells me how urgent it is. They are displayed left to right, top to bottom in order of urgency. Here you can see the name of the professor and the title of the course."

* **Make the demo a story that matches the problem and solution statement.** Demos which are just a tour of features are much less effective than those that explain a specific scenario. *"Imagine that our Professor Pito wanted to send a visitor, like you all, an email with directions on how to get from where they are parked, to where this meeting was. He told me he spent a lot of time figuring out how to write the directions. Well lets say he was using our product, here's how easy it would be. Oh and not only would you get a textual set of directions, but a link to our site with live tracking as you got here."*
