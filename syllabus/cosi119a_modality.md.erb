### Hybrid course

In Fall 2020 this course is primarily remote. Both the "lectures" and the labs will be conducted over zoom. If conditions allow it I will also have some in-person activities in the lab.

There are two 90 minute lectures as well as one 2 hour lab. All are mandatory. The schedule indicates two separate blocks of time for the lab. We will use one or both of these, but each student will be required to attend only one.
