## Participation (Pass/Fail) assignments
* **These assignments are marked by this icon: <%= partbadge %>**
* They allow you to show that you are participating in class, by reading and thinking about the work. 
* Your submissions are not marked for correctness but for participation. We require that you show a sincere *good faith* effort to respond to the question or prompt to receive a mark of 100.
* Otherwise you receive a mark of 0. (Non-pdf submissions lose 20 points, and not putting your name and assignment number will lose another 20 points, late submussions lose another 20 points.)
