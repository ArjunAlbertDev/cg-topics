title: Participation and Warmup Assignments

#### Participation Only Assignments <%= partbadge %>
* **These assignments are marked by this icon: <%= partbadge %>**
* They allow you to show that you are participating in class, by reading and thinking about the work. 
* Your submissions are not marked for correctness but for participation. We require that you show a sincere *good faith* effort to respond to the question or prompt to receive a mark of 100.
* Otherwise you receive a mark of 0. (Non-pdf submissions lose 20 points, and not putting your name and assignment number will lose another 20 points, late submussions lose another 20 points.)

#### Warmup Assignments <%= timebadge %>
* **These are marked by this icon: <%= timebadge %>**
* Some Participation assignments are further marked as warmups indicated by the above icon. 
* They are due at 10am of the day of class with no extension. 
* The reason is that we review your responses before class in order to structure some of the class content based on what we see in the responses.
