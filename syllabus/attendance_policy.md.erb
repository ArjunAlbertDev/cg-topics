##### Attendance and Participation

On time attendce of all classes are required unless you have arranged something ahead of time with me. Class begins exactly on time and failure to attend classes will result in a reduction in the final grade. There will be assignments for each class and every student is expected to come prepared to discuss them in detail. While attendance is not taken every class, there will be multiple random attendance spot checks which will be used to determine your overall attendance.
