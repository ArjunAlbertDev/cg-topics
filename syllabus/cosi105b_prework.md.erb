title: Cosi105b Required Preperation
desc: The course starts fast so you absolutely have to prepare ahead of time!
---
This course builds on Cosi166b (Capstone) that you will have completed. However depending on how long ago that was you might very well need to review some of the material. Also of course you may have a new or changed computer.

<%= callout("READ THIS", " I am serious when I recommend strongly that you invest a few hours before the first day of class. You will have a better time, learn more, and have more fun.") %>

#### 1. Install Ruby, Sinatra and required other software on your computer

##### Ruby 2.7.x - the latest version of Ruby

1. I recommend using a tool called `rbenv` to help with the installation: [rbenv installer](https://github.com/rbenv/
rbenv-installer#rbenv-installer)

1. Install Sinatra is as simple as `gem install sinatra`

##### Other software

1. You also must have a suitable text editor. I recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). There are others out there of course: Sublime Text, Atom are both popular but all the kool kids use vscode!

1. Install `git` (which you will need to use `github`)

#### 2. Review Ruby
You know that ruby is a very cool language with basic and advanced features. We will have a brief time at the start of the course to get into Ruby but it will really pay off if you get ahead on this.

Depending on how you best learn there are several approaches to take for learning Ruby. You can of course just use google to find resources and tutorails.

Our self-study site is [Learn Ruby The Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/preface.html). Students have had good success with it. Go through all the lessons up to 40. The first dozen or so are trivial, but soon it will get hard. It will pay off, believe me!

#### 3. Learn the (Unix) Shell (Command Line)
Throughout the course we are going to use the Unix command line extensively. If you are on a Mac, this is what you use in `terminal`. You may have to use it a lot more than you have in the past. Here are a couple of resources:

* [Mastering Bash and Terminal](https://www.blockloop.io/mastering-bash-and-terminal?utm_source=hackernewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=fav)
* [Learn Enough Command Line to be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial) seems to be a very nice resource.
