##### How do robots perceive what is going on around them?

1. **Big idea:** Robotics is extensively sensor driven
1. **Underlying technologies:**
   1. Lidar
   1. Odometry from servo motors
   1. Touch detectors
   1. GPS, Accelerometer
1. **Learning goal: Students will understand**
   1. Why sensors are crucial
   1. What kinds of sensors typical robots will have and what their purpose is
1. **Skill goals: Students will be able to:**
   1. Examine and show information being genrated by sensors, e.g. Lidar. Display this graphically and use it in a program
   1. Program a robot to perform a "roomba" pattern in a closed arena.
