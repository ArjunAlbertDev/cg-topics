##### How Do Robots Know Where They Are?

1. **Big idea:**  Robots estimate their position and orientation in the world using a combination of odometry, visual land- marks, and other types of sensory information.
1. **Underlying technologies:**
   1. Particle filters
   1. SLAM
1. **Learning goal: Students will understand**
   1. The uses and limitations of odometry and visual landmarks,
   1. the basic principles of particle filters, and how particle filters are used for localization.
1. **Skill goals: Students will be able to:**
   1. Demonstrate a robot avoiding obstacles using AMCL
   1. demonstrate effective robot navigation behavior by arranging landmarks appropriately in the environment and invoking the Pilot’s localization mechanism as needed to determine their robot’s position.
