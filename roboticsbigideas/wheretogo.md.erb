##### How Do Robots Know Where To Go?

1. **Big idea:** Robots navigate through the world using a path planner to search for routes around obstacles and an execution monitor to ensure that the robot stays on the path.
1. **Underlying technologies:**
   1. RRTs (Rapidly-exploring Random Trees)
1. **Learning goal: Students will understand**
   1. Concept of a stochastic search algorithm
   1. How the RRT-Connect algorithm is used for path planning, and how planning can fail.
1. **Skill goals: Students will be able to:**
   1. Invoke one of the Pilotâ€™s path planners to plan and execute paths through environments containing obstacles.
