## Description

This may sound hard but in fact there are many simple ways to create a video. The essence of it is that it is animated, there is sound and picture, and you can deliver it as a link to people (few or many) with an email or landing page.

## Watch out for

* It is important to decide on a script ahead of time. While it's not too hard to improvise your words, you waste a lot of time re-shooting the same thing because you lost your way in what you were trying to cover.
* Don't overproduce. It can be stick figures or stop motion. Just focus on the message you want to get across.

## When to use
* When there's a subtlety to what you want to test

## Examples
* [The Original Dropbox Video](https://youtu.be/xy9nSnalvPc)

## Tools
* Screencasts can be recorded right off your computer, with for example QuickTime. But there are lots of options
