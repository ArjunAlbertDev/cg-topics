#### Description
* A single page web site, used to convey information and measure interest
* Make sure it tests one or more actual hypotheses
* Content examples are: elevator pitch, nice screen shot, pricing page, etc.
* Most useful if also includes a way to measure results
* Passive google metrics are ok, but collecting something from visitors is far more powerful

#### Tips
* What hypotheses (plural) are you testing?
* Get your most artistic team member to do the design
* Choose the words very carefully
* How are you going to get it distributed widely?
* A/B Testing
	* Also known as "split testing"
	* Divide your targets into two (or more sets)
	* Show each of them an alternative version
	* Works best with a feature description, a marketing message, a price and so on.
* **IMPORTANT**: You need to find a way to drive traffic to your landing page of course. Here are some typical techniques:
  * Twitter
  * Email to some mailing list
  * Facebook friends
  * Facebook advertisements (but cost money :( )
