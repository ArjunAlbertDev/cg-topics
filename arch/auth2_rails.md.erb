title: Authentication and Authorization in Rails
---

#### Possible implementation strategies in Rails
1. Roll your own, using simple authentication. My preferred approach for this course.
1. Look at other options: [Clearance](https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance) or [Sorcery]( https://github.com/Sorcery/sorcery),  [Authlogic](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/binarylogic/authlogic), or [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise)
1. Look at GoRails, they have several relevant lessons: [GoRails Authentication](https://gorails.com/episodes/omniauth-twitter-sign-in?autoplay=1)
