  * User "state" across requests
  * May store, for example, whether they are logged in, what's in their shopping cart, what their access level is, etc.

	* <%= discussion "What does that mean exactly?" %>
	* Sessions: a general concept tying 'state' from one request to the next
	* Examples: who is logged in, what is in their cart, what product they want, etc.
	* A set of name-value pairs, whatever you need them to be
* Where is session stored?
	* Cookies
		* Fast and simple
		* Limit on size
	* On server
		* Still requires a 'session_id' of some kind
		* Indexed into a database of session state
* What should be stored in a session?
	* Anything. But remember it's just a bit of text!
	* Don't store objects. Store ids.
* Security
	* Session hijack attack
	* Decrypting cookies
* Rails options
	* `session_store = :cookie_store`
