    * Cannot access hardware of the mobile
    * Cannot be "installed" via the app store
    * Requires continuos connectivity
* Native Mobile App
  * [SWIFT on iOS](https://developer.apple.com/swift/)
  * [Java on Android](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
  * Pros/Cons:
    * Most complicated and expensive to implement
    * Hard to share code between platforms
    * Perfectly native user experience
    * Full access to hardware
    * Distribution through app store
* Hybrid App
  * Mobile web app
  * Embedded in a thin native shell application
  * Some of the screens are web and some are native (degree differs)
  * App is installed via stores
  * Pros/Cons
    * Not much more work than mobile web app
    * Solves some of their key weaknesses
    * Be very careful picking the framework. They come and go!
