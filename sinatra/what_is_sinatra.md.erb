title: What is Sinatra?
---

## What is Sinatra?
* A ruby library
* Easiest way to create a simple web server
* Much smaller and easy to understand than rails (also less powerful)
* What is Sinatra according to their own [Sinatra Intro](http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro.html)

## Components of a Sinatra app
* Single main ruby program
* Routing
  * One method for each "route"
  * Rendering of Views
  * Nice pattern matching to generalize similar routes
  * At the end of the method, either render html, json, or redirect
  * Each of the route methods are "kind of like" a controller
* Data
  * Sinatra doesn't do anything special about working with the database
  * Whatever database access you prefer will work
  * Our examples use ActiveRecord as a library to interface with the database
  * But there are other ones that work just as well
  * Typical design
    * encapsulates the data access in a class
    * one class for each table or entity
    * often referred to as a model class
* Views
  * Erb is a very common templating language
  * Look at <%= link_to_topic :erb_crib %>
  * They are what is generated at the end of the route method
  * In addition to erb there are tons of others
  * What they have in common: they all generate data (in the end) that is returned as the result of an HTTP request
