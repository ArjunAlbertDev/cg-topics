#### Facts
* Every lecture has a lecture number
* Every assignment has a code, X.Y, where X is the lecture number and Y is the assignment within that lecture
* The homework due for a particular lecture is always listed at the top of the page for that day.
* When there is something to hand in it will be marked as a "deliverable"
* Some homework is designated "Team Deliverable:" which means that a single deliverable is due for the team and all team members get the same mark for it.

#### Your responsibility
* You are responsible for reading the *lecture's page* before each class.
* All homework is handed in in Latte.
* All written reports, reflections, responses should be submitted as **PDF** and must include your name, team name if appropriate, and course number in the text of the submission.
* Code and other non-text submissions can be submitted as-is or as a .zip file
* Unless otherwise specfified, homework is due on class day at class start time.

#### Automatic deductions
* Late homework is deducted 20 points
* Missing homework is scored at zero
* If you don't hand in homework in the right form (e.g. "pdf, with your name and course number in the text") we will automatically deduct. 20 for no name, and another 20 for not in pdf form.
* No exceptions unless pre-agreed in an email by either the Professor or a TA.

#### Symbols

* <%= pdfbadge %>: Indicates that you are to submit a pdf to latte. Anything else will receive a 0.

#### Numbering scheme in detail:

* Homeworks that have an expected deliverable:
* Will be clearly marked as "deliverable" or "team deliverable"
* Can be identified by a code, X.Y: X is the lecture number and Y is the homework for this lecture
* Those are submitted to the appropriate spot in Latte, either as a .pdf (for writing) or as a .zip file
