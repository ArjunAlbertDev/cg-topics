title: Setting up a Linux Parition

## How to do it
There are numerous web sites with instructions on how to do this. They are all similar and different. You have to find one that makes sense to you. Here is a recent one that looks pretty good: [The Ultimate Windows 7 and Ubuntu Linux Dual Boot Guide](https://www.lifewire.com/ultimate-windows-7-ubuntu-linux-dual-boot-guide-2200653)

In general you have to:

1. If for some reason you have a bare machine, then install Windows first.
1. Make sure you have enough free diskspace before you begin. I think around 20gig should be plenty
1. Make sure you have a backup of your critical files
1. Now and only now, install Linux.
