* The textbook for this course is [Programming Robots With Ros](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Robots-ROS-Practical-Introduction/dp/1449323898). We call it **PRR** in these lecture notes.
* **Make very very sure that:**
    1. You are running on Ubuntu 18.04 [Lab Notebook Instructions](https://campus-rover.gitbook.io/lab-notebook/infrastructure/ros_melodic)
    1. You have installed ROS Melodic [Lab Notebook Instructions](https://campus-rover.gitbook.io/lab-notebook/infrastructure/ros_melodic)
    1. As you read the book, follow along the <%= link_to_section :background, :rosbook %> for clarifications and corrections. If you ignore them you will get into trouble!
    1. Find all the code in the github repo: [prrexamples](https://github.com/campusrover/prrexamples)
