### Very important note!

<%= callout("NB", " The examples in the book do not work by themselves!!")%>

* The textbook for this course is [Programming Robots With Ros](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-robots-with/9781449325480/). We call it **PRR** in these lecture notes. You can get free access to it as a Brandeis student.
* **Make very very sure that:** As you read the book, follow along the [Programming Guide for PRR Book](http://cosi119a.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/content/background/10_rosbook.md/) for clarifications and corrections. If you ignore them you will get into trouble!
