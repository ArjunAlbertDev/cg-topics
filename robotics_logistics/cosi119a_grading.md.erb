title: Grading
---
Grading will be based on the following:

* Participation: Attendance to lectures and lab. Engagement with the course, participation in class and lab discussions, responding to questions. Documenting in the Lab Notebook as requested or required. Submission of "participation (pass/fail)" assignments.  This will be assessed by the instructor's personal observations combined with grading of specific participation assigments. (10%)

* Individual: Submission of high quality homework assignments, showing an understanding of the purpose and intent of the assignment, going deep instead of the shortest way out. Each homework will be assessed based on a rubric. (40%)

* Final Project: The last 4-5 weeks of the course will be devoted to a final project. The requirements will be discussed in class. These will be team projects with as many students as the ambitiousness of the goal indicates. Assessment will be based on dual grading (Instructor and TA grade independently.) (50%)
