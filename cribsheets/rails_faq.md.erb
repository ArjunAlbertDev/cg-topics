#### Database and ActiveRecord

##### Naming and plurals
This is super confusing. Model name should be capitalized and singular, model file name is lower case. Corresponding database table is lower case plural. So:
<%= source_begin("language-ruby") %># file: car_part.rb
# database table: car_parts
class CarPart
    ...
end<%= source_end %>

##### Associations

You need to put in both sides of the relation between two models, so:
<%= source_begin("language-ruby") %>class CarPart
   belongs_to :car
   ...
end

class Car
   has_many :car_parts
end<%= source_end %>

##### Many to many relations

* Do not use has_and_belongs_to_many
* Whenever you think many to many, you will need an extra "bridging" table
