title: "PA6: Fiducial Slam"
desc: Respond to fiducials and use them for navigation
---
#### Summary

Several fiducials are mounted on walls within the robot arena. On startup, the robot spins until it sees the nearest fiducial. That fiducial is established as coordiante 0,0,0, with the orientation from the point of view of the fiducial, that is, x is in front of it, y is to its left and z is vertical from it. The robot then moves until it sees a second fiducial and computes the fiducial's coordinates based on the first one. With that calibration, the user gives the robot a new coordiante to drive to and it successfullly does so.
