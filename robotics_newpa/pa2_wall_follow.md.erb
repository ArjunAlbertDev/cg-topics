title: "PA2: Wall Follow "
desc: Teach the robot to follow a wall
---
#### Summary

Write ROS code to have the robot find a wall, drive up to .5 meters of it, then turn and start following it at that distance

##### Skills you will learn:

* Working with and processing Lidar data
* Working with very noisy data, and filtering it to find the signal
* How to use PID processing to make the robot behave reasonably
* Simple state management to control the behavior of the robot

##### Content knowledge you will gain:

* /scan topic, its format
* PID Processing, what it means and how it works

##### Examples of this in the teal world
* supply a link or paper or video)

##### What to hand in
* Zip up your source code
* A video (informal) of the robot executing the code

#### Tasks

##### Think through the design
* Look at what /scan data looks like using a test program or rqt_chart
* Read about PID processing and consider how you might use it

##### write wall_follow.launch

##### write wall_follow.py
*

##### test it in Rviz

##### test it in the actual robot
