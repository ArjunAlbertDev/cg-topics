title: "Fiducial Slam"
desc: Respond to fiducials and use them for navigation
---
#### Summary

Several fiducials are mounted on ceilings or walls within the robot arena. 

On startup, the robot spins until it sees the nearest fiducial, called Fiducial#1. That fiducial is established as coordinate 0,0,0, with the orientation from the point of view of the fiducial, that is, x is in front of it, y is to its left and z is vertical from it. 

The fiducials are placed so that it is easy to see two fiducials at once. For example they are attached to the ceiling. When the robot can see Fiducial#1 at the same time as Fiducial#n, it can determine the location of Fiducial#n relative to 1. By the same process, the additional fiducials can all be localized relative to fiducial#1.

An alternative definition of this assignment is:

Several fiducials are mounted on walls within the robot arena. Using real-world measuring tape, we determine the position and orientation of each fiducial relative to the space. As the robot navigates around, either building or creating it's map, it will from time to time encounter a fiducial may be located where the map has not been built yet, or, where there are no mappable obstacles. In that way the fiducial helps navigate in areas where there is no map.
