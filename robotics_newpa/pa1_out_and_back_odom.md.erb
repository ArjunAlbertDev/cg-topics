#### Summary

Write ROS code to drive the robot out 1 meters, rotate 180 degrees and return. We use a slightly more sophisticated approach. The robot reports what position (pose) and orientation (twist) it (thinks it) is. We track it and stop the motion or rotation accordingly.

##### Equipment

* TurtleBot 3

##### Skills you will learn:

* writing a basic ROS node which subscribes to several topics
* installing and running the node on the robot
* design and write a ROS action
* how to process odometry to 
* writing a launch file

##### Content knowledge you will gain:

* /cmd_vel and Twist
* /odom

##### Examples of this in the teal world
* supply a link or paper or video)

##### What to hand in
* Zip up your source code
* A video (informal) of the robot executing the code

#### Tasks

##### write the out_and_pack_timed.py

##### write out_and_back_action_server.py

##### write out_and_back.launch

##### test it in Rviz

##### test it in the actual robot
