#### Summary

Write ROS code to drive the robot out 1 meters, rotate 180 degrees and return. The simplest way of doing this is by commanding the robot to go at a certain speed for a certain amount of time.

##### Equipment

* TurtleBot 3

##### Skills you will learn:

* writing a basic ROS node which subscribes to several topics
* installing and running the node on the robot
* writing a launch file

##### Content knowledge you will gain:

* /cmd_vel and Twist

##### Examples of this in the real world
* supply a link or paper or video)

##### What to hand in
* Zip up your source code
* A video (informal) of the robot executing the code

#### Tasks

* See xxx for how to set up your package initially

##### write the out_and_pack_time.py

* Publish to `/cmd_vel` at a slow speed (e.g. 0.1 meters per second)
* If you know the current time, you can loop until 10 seconds have passed
* Which would approximate one meter
* Do a similar approac to rotate

##### write out_and_back_time.launch

* See xxx for the syntax of a launch file
* Remember to chmod +x your script
* Run it with roslaunch command

##### test it in Rviz or Gazebo

* Follow these instructions to create your simulated robot: `xxxx`
* Now run your app and see that it does what you expect

##### test it in the actual robot

* The program does not have to be changed
* Follow these instructions to turn on and bring up the robot
* Test your pogram
