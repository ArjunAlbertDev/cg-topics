title: "Follow outdoor path"
desc: Teach the robot to ride outdoors!
---
#### Summary

We have an outdoor track which is about 10 meters long, in a straight line. It is marked by a 6 inch wide yellow line which has strong contrast to the ground around it. The goal is to write or extend what you have written so far to allow the robot to follow this path, using simple computer vision from one end to the other, then rotate in place and drive back.

##### Equipment
* CR4 with a depth camera
* Outdoor path marked (with cones? with a line?)

##### Skills you will learn:

* Processing information coming from the robot camera
* Using basic CV algorithms to find the line to follow and then update the velocity and direction to try and stay on that line
* Using the robot outdoors where the path is rough, there is sunlight, and other annoying things

##### Content knowledge you will gain:

* Commputer Vision with OpenCV
* Key functions and technoques for processing images
* What the data coming from a camera and a depth camera looks like and how to interpret it.

##### Examples of this in the teal world
* supply a link or paper or video)

##### What to hand in
* Zip up your source code
* A video (informal) of the robot executing the code

#### Tasks

##### Think through the design
*
