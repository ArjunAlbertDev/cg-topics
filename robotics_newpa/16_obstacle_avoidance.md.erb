title: "Obstacle Avoidance "
desc: Follow track while avoiding obstacles
---
#### Summary

This time we build a track using the red bricks that we used for wall following. The robot will drive from the start to the end (or really any route) and avoid obsracles, , both stationary and moving. The robot traverses that confidently as well, without colliding with any obstacles. This assignment is quite different in that you will be learning and using the built in SLAM navigation.

##### Equipment

* Track is made with red blocks
* TB3 with Lidar

##### Skills you will learn:

* Using move_base to detect and avoid obstacles
* Debugging a multi-node ROS program

##### Content knowledge you will gain:

* How ROS processes Lidar or visual data
* How ROS reports the presence of obstacles and does short range replanning

##### Examples of this in the real world
* supply a link or paper or video)

##### What to hand in
* Zip up your source code
* A video (informal) of the robot executing the code

#### Tasks

##### Think through the design
*
