title: GoPiGo3 Intro
---
## Introduction
* [GoPiGo3](https://www.dexterindustries.com/gopigo3/) - Inexpensive Robot used this semester for Autonomous Robotics @ Home
* Made by [Dexter Industries](https://www.dexterindustries.com)

### Main Parts

* GoPiGo3 Hardware Board - motor controllers and logic
* Rasberry Pi - Runs Linux and ROS
* Battery Pack
* YdLidar LIDAR

### GoPiGo3 Hardware Board
* The GoPiGo3 hardware board contains an ATMEL ATMEGA328
* The ATMEGA328 firmware is proprietary and no firmware documentation is released
* The GoPiGo3 board receives commands from and returns data to the Raspberry Pi via SPI interface
* The command set is enumerated in the SPI_MESSAGE_TYPE in gopigo3.py
* The GoPiGo3 firmware monitors battery level, manages servo PWM, motor PID control, encoders
* The GoPiGo3 board firmware manages the programmable “Grove” connectors
    * Analog Input on pin A or B
    * Digital Input or Output on pin A or B
    * Software I2C clock and data

### Rasberry Pi
* The Raspberry Pi based user software and Dexter software
* Dexter software consists of
    * a large library of drivers / examples for 3rd party “Grove” Analog, Digital, and I2C based sensors
    * drivers and examples for Dexter Industries sensors
        * VL53L0X I2C Time Of Flight Distance Sensor
        * BNO055 Inertial Measurement Sensor (Software I2C for clock stretching that RPi does not)
        * Temp/Humidity/Pressure Sensor, light color sensor, line follower, …
    * Phenomenal robot examples (/home/pi/Dexter/GoPiGo3/Projects)
* Raspbian For Robots (Supports several DI products. Only listing GoPiGo3 stuff)
    * service providing landing page to desktop and web based command shell
    * power button handler (/home/pi/Dexter/GoPiGo3/install/gpg3_power.sh)
    * GoPiGo3 Custom Desktop widgets
        * Software Update
        * Shutdown
        * GoPiGo3 Control Panel
        * Line Follower Calibration
        * Scratch For Robots
        * Advanced Communications applet
        * GoPiGo3 Folder shortcut to docs, all software
        * Version applet lists Raspbian For Robots version
        * Test and Troubleshoot Applet
    * Services
        * Customized Apache server
        * noVNC (in stretch version - I think real VNC in the buster version)
        * antenna_wifi.service to manage the multi-color WiFi LED
        * The schematic (and all software) is on github:
