#### Thoughts about Lean Startup

<%= include_image("/content/topics/images/build_measure_learn.png", extra:"class=\"pull-right\"") %>

* Basically: identify the right product for the right customer
* "Lean" term stolen from "Lean Manufacturing" (Toyota et al)
* Some key characteristics:
	* Small Batches vs. Large Batches
	* Minimize WIP
	* Changes in plan are expected and embraced
	* "Pull" vs. Push
	* Small self-managed teams
  * Don't try to plan everything from day one
  * Instead, Iterate, iterate, iterate!
* Agile Software Development (next term :)
	* Also based on the same principles
	* And with the same objectives
* Lean Startup
	* Yes, just another buzzword
	* Some might say "there's nothing new under the sun"
	* Realize there are several 'methodologies' that people push
	* The underlying principles are similar
* My own experience with the idea of Lean Startup
	* Where did it come from
	* Is it just Eric Ries self promotion?
	* Why do I think it's a good approach
	* "Scientific method?"
* Some ideas that we'll explore more in the next few weeks
	* Validated Learning
	* Build/Measure/Learn
	* Hypotheses and assumptions
	* Minimum Viable Product
	* Customer Development
	* Pivoting
  * Metrics and real-world data
	* Innovation accounting
