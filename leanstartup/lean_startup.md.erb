title: Lean Startup Overview
---

## Where it came from


* Basically: identify the right product for the right customer
* "Lean" term stolen from "Lean Manufacturing" (Toyota et al)
* Some key characteristics:
	* Small Batches vs. Large Batches
	* Minimize WIP
	* Changes in plan are expected and embraced
	* "Pull" vs. Push
	* Small self-managed teams
  * Don't try to plan everything from day one
  * Instead, Iterate, iterate, iterate!
* Agile Software Development
	* Also based on the same principles
	* And with the same objectives
