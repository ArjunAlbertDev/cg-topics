title: Measure the effect of a pivot

## Measuring effect of a pivot
* The crux of pivoting is having metrics on which to base the decision
* Identify the key 'milestones' or 'stages' in users' interaction with the product
* Example:
  * Registration (sign up)
  * Activation  (log into account, verify user is registered voter, etc.)
  * Particpation (add content, write a review, etc.)
  * Retention (log in a second, third, etc. time)
  * Referral (invite friend, recruit your network, etc


<%= discussion_box "What would stages be for our product?" %>

## Stages
* These are not arbitrary!! they figure directly into your eventual business model
* depending on your goals and your stage they will be different
  * How many people responded to your email
  * answered your survey
  * answered a question
  * asked a question
  * etc.
* This becomes a classic "funnel" (sales, marketing etc.)
* <%= discussion "why do you think we call it a funnel?" %>

* Metrics... Metrics... Metrics
  * You also need a way to measure how many people make it to each step
  * Without metrics your pivots are a shot in the dark
* Once you have a baseline
  * Do the pivot
  * Quickly determine if you improved where you expected to improved
