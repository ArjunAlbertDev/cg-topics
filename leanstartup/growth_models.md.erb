#### Sustainable growth

<%= callout("Key Idea", " When new customers come from the action of past customers.") %>

* Excludes one-time campaigns and actions
* Systematic: built into the product's usage
* Comes from actions of past and existing users or customers
* There are many ways in which using a product can lead to a growth in revenue
	* Word Of Mouth (people recommend your product to others)
	* Side Effect of Usage (people see you using and want to use it too. Or in order to benefit you have to invite.)
	* In-product purchases (part of the experience of the product requires you to spend money inside it.)
	* Subscription (or need to re-buy) (access charges, periodicals, expiration or consumption.)
	* Funded advertising (When advertising gets more users, and is funded from revenue from users.)

#### Engine of Growth
* We know that without growth we don't have a business
* Engine of Growth is a way to reason and organize thinking around this
* It is the mechanism whereby a startup means to achieve susstainable growth
* The focus of the analysis is around the *metrics* that are necessary
* The Metrics not only tell you whether you will grow but guides to where to invest to grow

#### Four example growth models

##### Sticky Engine of Growth
* Concept: A subscription model that needs to be renewed
* Key Metrics
	* Customer acquisition rate (new customers per unit time)
	* Churn rate (customers lost per unit time)
	* Customer retention rate
* Rule
	* Rate of new customer acquistion exceeds the churn rate then the company will growth
* Focus
	* Attracting new customers and retaining the ones you have
	* Understand why a customer did not renew the service and address those issues.
* Example
	* Home cleaning application and service
	* Inherent in the service is that the house will need cleaning periodically
	* The service is inherently sticky

##### Viral Engine of Growth
* Concept
	* Simple normal use of the product leads to new sales
	* Powerd by a "viral loop"
* Key Metrics
	* "Viral Coefficient" - how many new customers a single customer brings in, and over what period
	* Viral coefficient should be > 1 to get exponential growth
* Focus
	* Increase the viral coefficient
* Example
	* Dropbox: strong incentive of a new user to invite additional users
	* Users were given an incentive to do this, more free diskspace

##### Paid Engine of Growth
* Concept
	* Simple paid product
	* Still need to pay attention to metrics!
* Key Metrics
	* Customer Lifetime Value (LTV): How much does a single customer bring in over their lifetime (as long as they use the product)
	* Customer Acquisiton Cost (CPA): How much (in sales costs, advertisting, etc.) does it cost to acquire a single customer
	* Growth depends on the simple ratio of customer acquisition cost vs. per customer earnings
* Focus
	* LTV of a customer tells you how much you can spend on customer acquisition
	* Simply add more money to customer acquisition and you get a predictable amount of earnings from that.
* Example
	* Ad costs $100 and it predictably causes 2 customers to sign up. CPA = $50.00
	* Average customer spends $25 per year and lasts an average of 1.5 years). LTV = $37.50
	* If LTV > CPA the company grows, because profits can be invested in more ads or sales people
