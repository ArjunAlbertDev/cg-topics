title: Minimum Viable Product
---
#### The MVP or Minimum Viable Product
* "It's not necessarily minimal nor a product nor viable!"
* MVP is not a perfectly descriptive term
* "An experiment is a product" (From TLS book)
* Smallest increment of work that will test a hypothesis
* What forms can it take?
* The key is that it is *MINIUM!*
* MVP is always always related to a hypothesis (or more than one)
* Who and where do you show your MVP?
	* Product Reviews of other products might give you names
	* Other feedback fora
	* Think about: where do they congregate?
	* Who are _they_?
	* Find a way to observe them

* Discussion: Does MVP mean that quality is not important?
