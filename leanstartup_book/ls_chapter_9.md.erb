  * "Supply Chain" management
  * "Just in time" manufacturing
* What is the fastest way to stuff envelopes
  * Two arguments:
    * Small batches detect problems earlier and allow them to be corrected
    * Less "work in progress" means less handling of half-completed work product
    * Less capital sitting around
* How Software Develoment used to be done
  * Waterfall (MRD, Product Spec, Architecture, Development, Testing)  
  * What are the problems?
  * Nowadays?
    * All are happening at once
    * Some companies "release" multiple times PER DAY!
  * Some of this is new concepts and some of it is enabled by new technology.
* Continuous Deployment
  * "Hardware is becoming software"
  * "Mass Custimization" (engraved iPhone!)
  * 3D Printing of parts (in SPACE!)
* Small batches in Education
* Large Batch Death Cycle
