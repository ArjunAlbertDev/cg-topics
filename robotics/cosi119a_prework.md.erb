We are going to jump right in so it is crucial that you invest time so that you are at the same level as your classmates and we can begin productive work right away. Here are the three important steps:

Our TAs will have prepared a bootable Solid State Drive for you which you can loan from the lab for $40 which will be reimbursed at the end of the term.

3. **Linux**: Learn Linux and the Linux shell
