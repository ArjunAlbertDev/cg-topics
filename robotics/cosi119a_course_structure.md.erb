#### Course Structure
With only one meeting a week, a lot if not most of the work will happen outside that meeting, with students working independently in the Robotics Lab. There is an expectation and reliance on students' independence, initiative, self-motivation, and problem solving skills.

##### Week 1-5 - Rampup
During the first 5 weeks you will what you need to know about ROS. ROS is a rich distributed operating system which is used both in research and commerce. We will learn it through reading, discussions and programming exercises. 

##### Week 6-13 - Projects
Using Kanban, students form and reform small teams to work on interesting stories. The stories are written by the Product Owner, and generally are the result of brainstorming with students about what they think we should do next. The teams can be from 1 to 5 students, for 1-4 weeks, depending on the project.
