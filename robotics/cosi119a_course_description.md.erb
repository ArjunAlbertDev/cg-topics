#### Introduction

Robots are everywhere, working quietly behind the scenes in labs and factories, on highways and in the home and now constantly on the front page. It is a rich area of Computer Science Research and at the same time a challenging arena of Applied Computer Science and Engineering. This makes for a very attractive context for learning.

In this course you will gain an understanding of how mobile robots are designed and work, while contributing towards the long term development of the **Campus Rover**. We will read the seminal papers from the field, and program algorithms on actual robots! You will learn concepts like localization, navigation, SLAM, and of Arduino, ROS, and many more are surveyed and applied to a variety of projects.

You will be working on a team, designing, implemnting and testing components of the robot. While there are weekly class meetings, the bulk of the learning (and work) will come during out-of-classroom team and lab work. You will be expected to do a lot of individual research to solve problems and get over obstacles because of the newness of this field. Test your self-sufficiency and persistence in the face of setbacks. Whether you choose to go deeper into robotics or not, the experiences of learning from failure, and learning how to confront major unknowns will hopfully be important and meaningful.
