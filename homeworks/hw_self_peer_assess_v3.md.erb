title: Self and Peer assessments

1. <%= partbadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> **Self and Peer Assessments:** Assess your own and each of your teammates contribution to your team. Consider attendance and timeliness to the team meetings, contributions in words and deeds to the work and the deliverables, contribution to positivity and harmony, willingness to step in when things go wrong. Write up a brief justification of your assessment, one or two lines for each team member including yourself. 

Put the team members in order from most positive to least positive. Give each one a number between 9 (most) and 1 (least) **and don't give two people the same number**

  <%= deliverable("Posted on latte as a pdf. It should be around 5-10 lines of text total. Failure to follow the format, or giving two students the same rating will lead to a loss of 20 points.")%> **Follow this format EXACTLY:**
