#### Here are the steps:

* Read the overview below

* **Setting up your cloud architecture - <%= link_to_topic :hw_service_api_1 %>**

* **Setting up your Sinatra app - <%= link_to_topic :hw_service_api_2 %>**

* **Setting up CI/CD - <%= link_to_topic :hw_service_api_3 %>**

#### Overall Objective

In this homework, we will create a multi-server architecture for making a simple app for creating and retrieving a list of users from the database! The homework proceeds in 4 steps. Each one will be assigned separately.

#### Architecture

* The structure of your final resilt will include multiple droplets
* The logic of each will be trivial. 
* Our objective here is to practice creating a multi-node architecture and deploying it

##### Digital Ocean Architecture

* Each individual will have two droplets named, e.g. pito-frontend and pito-service
* Each team will share the postgres managed database across the students, as well as with the team's nano twitter.
* The droplets are
    * Sinatra Frontend (1 Droplet). Responsible for asking the Service API for the list of users, and render a html page for it.
    * Sinatra Service API (1 Droplet). Responsible for talking to Postgres and retrieving Users' information.

#### Flow

* The request logic will look like this:
