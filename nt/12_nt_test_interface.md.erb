title: nT Test Interface
---
#### Test Interface

The Test Interface essentially is a set of URLs which invoke special functionality that allows your nanoTwitter to be tested from a browser, and is the foundation of the scalability testing we will be doing.

##### The Test user

There's a user that we use as part of many of the tests. We refer to the user as "testuser". When you create that user use the following attributes:

* name: testuser
* email: testuser@sample.com
* password: "password"

#### Test Data
* Url to reset and load the standard seed is: /test/reset/standard?tweets=n&users=u&follows=u
* Dataset is the standard <%= link_to_topic :nt_seed_data %>
* If necessary, you may modify the creation dates of tweets, but all the other data should be intact
* Note that in our tests, n will be 7000 or less

##### Here are the URLs of the test interface

* POST /test/reset/all
  * If needed deletes all users, tweets, follows
  * Recreates TestUser
  * Example: `test/reset/all`
* POST /test/reset/standard?users=u
  * Deletes all users, tweets and follows
  * Recreate TestUser
  * Imports data from standard seed data, see: <%= link_to_topic :nt_seed_data %>
    * ?users=n means to import n users from the seed data...
    * Including all the related follows (i.e. both users need to be present)
    * And all the related tweets
  * Example: `/test/reset/standard?users=100&tweets=100
* GET /test/user/{u}/tweets?count=n
  * {u} can be the user id of some user, or the keyword testuser
  * n is how many randomly generated tweets are submitted on that users behalf
* GET /test/status
  * One page "report":
    * How many users, follows, and tweets are there
    * What is the TestUser's id
  * Example: `/test/status`
