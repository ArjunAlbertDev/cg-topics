## PRR Chapter 1: Introduction

### Our Environment

* A little different because of the virus
* You will be working individually on your own computers
* Later on you will acquire a robot of your own
* Labs will all be on zoom
* You will be paired up, over zoom, with 2 other students to form a team

<%= callout "NB", " These series of notes were written by me following the outline and content of \"Programming Robots With ROS\" by Quigley, Gerkey and Smart. In my opinion it's one of the best ROS books for students. It has a great sequence on the concepts and then gradually more challenging projects. It uses Python which is ideal for students. The only problem is that it is a little old and so some of the instructions don't work anymore. I highly recommend this book." %>
