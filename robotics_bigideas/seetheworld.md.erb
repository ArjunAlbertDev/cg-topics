##### How Do Robots See The World?
1. **Big idea:** Robots use sophisticated but imperfect computer vision algorithms to deduce real world object representations from arrays of pixels.
1. **Underlying technologies:**
   1. basic vision algorithms (e.g., Hough transforms AprilTags [10], 
   1. SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) [7]1. face detection
1. **Learning goal: Students will understand**
   1. Both the capabilities and limitations of state of the art machine perception algorithms.
1. **Skill goals: Students will be able to:**
   1. Use the MapBuilder to demonstrate the function of several built-in vision algorithms, and use these components effectively in robotics applications.
