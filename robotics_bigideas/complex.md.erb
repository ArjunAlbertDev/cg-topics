##### What if a Robot Becomes Too Complex to understand? 

1. **Big idea:** Robots are complex software systems that em- ploy standard abstraction and software engineering techniques to manage complexity.
1. **Underlying technologies:**
   1. Tools such as object oriented design, coding standards, open source
   1. Source code management, Automated testing
1. **Skill goals: Students will be able to:**
   1. Students will be able to search and navigate through the extensive online documentation (over 3500 web pages)
   1. Make appropriate use of abstraction mechanisms (e.g., write classes that inherit from predefined node types, 1. Create appropriate enumerated types for state machine signaling), produce code that conforms to Tekkotsu coding conventions, and give a picture of the modular organization of Tekkotsu in terms of directories and namespaces.
