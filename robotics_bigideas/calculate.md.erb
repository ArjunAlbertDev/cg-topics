##### How Do We Calculate the Quantities Needed To Make A Robot Function?
1. **Big idea:** Geometry, trigonometry, and linear algebra are the mathematical underpinnings of much of robotics.
1. **Underlying technologies:**
   1. Tekkotsu’s angular arithmetic classes and fmat matrix/vector manipulation package.
1. **Learning goal: Students will understand**
   1. Frames of reference, angular and vector arithmetic, homogeneous coordinates, coordinate transformation matrices
   1. how these concepts are applied in robotics.
1. **Skill goals: Students will be able to:**
   1. Students will be able to solve simple kinematics problems using Tekkotsu’s built-in kinematics solvers and matrix/vector classes.
