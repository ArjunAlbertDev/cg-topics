##### How Do Robots Control Their Bodies?

1. **Big idea:** Robots describe their bodies as kinematic trees and use kinematics solvers to translate between joint angles and body coordinates.
1. **Underlying technologies:**
   1. Kinematic description files, forward and inverse kinematics solvers.
1. **Learning goal: Students will understand**
   1. Students will understand kinematic descriptions expressed as trees of joints and links
   1. How kinematics solvers use this representation when translating between world coordinates and joint coordinates.
1. **Skill goals: Students will be able to:**
   1. Students will be able to construct and visualize kinematic descriptions using Tekkotsuâ€™s DH Wizard tools
   1. Invoke kinematics solvers via the Lookout or Grasper to produce desired robot motions.
