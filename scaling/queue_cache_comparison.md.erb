* Both are techniques to achieve more scale
* More scale requires finding and "fixing" bottlenecks
* "Bottleneck" = "A narrow place"
* A slow operation at a busy place
* How to speed up?

### Caching
* Is *slow data retrieval* the problem?
* Is it ok for the data to be a little bit stale?
* Does access follow repeating patterns?
* Can process continue even without the result?

### Queueing
* Is *slowness of the actual procedure* the problem?
* Is the operation done for its "side effects"?
* Can the process continue even without the operation completion?
