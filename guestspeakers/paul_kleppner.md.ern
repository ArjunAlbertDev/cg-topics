We are lucky today to have Paul Kleppner filling in for me. Paul is a Product Architect at Adobe where he has had first hand experience with their sprawling scalable infrastructure. I've known Paul for many years, at Lotus Development and other companies where we have worked together. He has been on the technical side of many companies, as a programmer, team lead, project leader, architect and manager. But all the while he has remained very close to the code, keeping his hands dirty and up to date with the latest technology. He has quite a [list of patents to his name](https://patents.google.com/?inventor=Paul+Kleppner).
