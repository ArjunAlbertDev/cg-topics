We are lucky today to have Professor Keith Merrill of the Brandeis Mathematics Department. Keith happens to be one of the most popular Math professors at Brandeis. His research lies at the intersection of number theory, dynamics, and geometry; specifically the field of Diophantine approximation [Ed: HUH???].
