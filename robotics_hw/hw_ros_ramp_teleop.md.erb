title: Teach Robot to dance!
---

#### Objective

This is to get practice with some more pyton, with a program which both publishes and subscribes, and also with rqt_plot. It's open ended so you can elaborate on the general idea below.

#### Steps

1. If you want, you can start with rosbook/scripts/keys_to_twist_with_ramps.py
1. Keep the default commands for forward, left, right and reverse
1. Add logic that makes sure that the robot does not collide with a wall (assume a rectangular pen)
1. Add two new one letter commands to do some new interesting things
    1. j -> evasive manouver - where the robot travels in a spiralling motion away from where it was
    2. k ->  hide in a corner - where the robot travels until it comes to a wall, and then follows the wall to a corner and stops
    3. l -> be creative and come up with something
1. Note that while doing a longer manouver, commands to go left, right, forward and backward can be ignored
1. Use rqt_plot to visualize what's happening
1. Be ready to demo this on Wed during lab!
