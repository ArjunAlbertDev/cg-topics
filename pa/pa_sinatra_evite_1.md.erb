title: Sinatra Evite 1
---
This is the next in a sequence of Programming Assignments to get you more and more comfortable with Sinatra.

* Your assignment is to use the samples of Sinatar code we've been working with and it will be tracking people, events and registrations. You can think of this as a simplistic Evite. 
* Make sure you write some tests to demonstrate that the code is actually working correctly, especially the associations.
* Include a Readme as always which includes at least your name

## Here is a suggested sequence:

1. Start with one of the samples in [sinatra_examples](https://github.com/pitosalas/sinatra_examples)
1. You will have three tables:
    * Person: name, date-of-birth, gender and zipcode
    * Events: name, date
    * Registrations: who is registering (person_id), what they are registering for (event_id), and status: a text field containing: coming, not coming, maybe.
1. Create the migrations for those three tables
1. At the url ./persons list all the persons
1. At the url ./events list all the events
1. At the url ./registrations list all the registrations
1. At the url ./person/new: display a form allowing the creation of a person
1. At the url ./event/new: display a form allowing the creation of a event
1. At the url ./registration/new: display a form allowing the creation of a registrations

## Deliverable
* Simply zip up your working code and submit it to sintra
