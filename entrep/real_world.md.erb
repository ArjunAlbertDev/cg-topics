## Do what you said you would do

* Immediately you are in the top 25% of professionals
* Say what you are going to do, and do what you say
* No one is perfect, sh*t happens, so...
* Underpromising?
* Be willing to make specific (not wishy washy) commitments, including scope and date
* And then do what it takes to deliver - or make sure you let  people know

## Networking
* It's a gift economy
* The personal network you start building now is more powerful than anything else I say
* Who do you know - who knows you?
* It's an ongoing project
* Karma. What you sow is what you reap
* Know why you want to talk; know why you'd be worth talking to
* Book: [Never Eat Alone](https://www.amazon.com/Never-Eat-Alone-Expanded-Updated/dp/0385346654)

### How?
* When you meet someone interesting, make effort to make a connection
* Keep a notebook of people you've met who are 'interesting' [Template People Networking](https://docs.google.com/a/brandeis.edu/spreadsheets/d/1--Se7Dg1PtvjyT7U58WlDAWS-hGOxEVBUoiLBgEf4DE/edit?usp=sharing)
* Invest a little in the relationship: jeep in touch with some regularity
* Phone call, email, invite for coffee
* Figure out why you want to talk to them and tell them
* Make sure it's mutually 'useful'

### LinkedIn
* Some people have reservations about LinkedIn... Don't
* Please join now and connect to me.
* Lets look someone up (Fake account Joan Salas)
* Designing your profile

## Jobs

### Where to apply, from worse to best
* info@bigco.com
* meet at a career fair
* someone you know even a little
* someone who knows you well
* A 'warm intro'

### What they do and don't look for, and what they avoid
* Look for
  * Specific content knowledge, obviously
  * Self-starter
  * Perseverence, solves own problems
  * Can get things done even when there's no grade attached
* Hardly look at
  * Your GPA
  * Your three majors
* What they avoid
  * High maintenance people

### Resumes
* Remember: Not what they can do for you; what can you do for them
* Competitive advantage/ What makes you special? (professionally)
* Who looks at them, for how long
* Type, color, pages, appearance
* Put github name or portfolio near the top
* When needed: Career goal; Special qualifications
* Cover letters
* Have dates and make sure they add up
* Put skills etc. in priority order (what you know best goes first)
* One page resume rule
* Personalize resume based on job/job type (within reason)

## Companies

### Typical functions in 'Tech' Companies
* Development or engineering
* Quality Assurance or testing
* Product Management
* Sales and Business Development
* Marketing
* Finance

### Large companies
* Fewer interactions outside of department (less personal)
* Process/politics/paperwork etc.
* Career paths: multiple products, departments -- more opportunities
* Can get laid off out of nowhere - less connection between you and your job security
* Less scrutiny on each individual employee

### Small Companies
* Less process, take initiative to get things done (fix your own problems)
* Very focused; Lives & breathes the one project/product - not good if you want to experience more than one type of thing
* No room/limited room for mistakes (Spotlight)
* Easy access to higher-ups

### Choosing 
* Location
* People
* Risk factors. Runway. Layoffs.
* Big vs. Small company

### Interviews
* Dress, demeanor:
  * Body Language
  * Enthusiasm
* Trick questions:
  * "What salary are you looking for?"
  * "Are you a hard worker?"
  * "When can you start"?
  * "Whats your greatest weakness?"

* Taxes and Benefits
  * Some companies withhold taxes automatically
  * 401K- deposits are not taxed
  * Some companies match a portion of salary
  * 5% match - they will match up to 5% of your income

* Stock purchase plan
  * vesting - you can buy stock but you cannot get it unless you work at the company for x amount of time
  * Significance of each benefit depends on person
