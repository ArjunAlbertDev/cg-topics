title: Balance Stick
desc: Make a robot balance a stick on it's head
---
The core idea is to demonstrate balancing by a robot. But it's not obvious especially with our robots. If you place a stick on top of a turtlebot3, there's no way for it to see or detect it and so it's unclear how it could possibly balance it. 

You could mount an upfaceing camera and use image processing to see the stick and respond to its motion away from vertical. However, our robots only drive forward and backwards, not left and right.

So instead of a general stick, it could be stick on a hinge that allows it only to move forward and backwards. The robot could drive forward and backwards to keep the stick pointing up. But that is not nearly as cool.

So more thought is needed around this project. But the high level goal seems quite nice and worth figuring out.
