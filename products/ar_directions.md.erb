title: Follow the Red Line
desc: A direction finding tool for pedestrians
---
It happens all the time that visitors on a campus want to find a certain building. The maps are terrible. Google maps is not so good for pedestrians. What we want is an app where the visitor chooses the Brandeis building list and it displays an AR line superimposed on the camera view, that they just need to follow to find their way to the building.
