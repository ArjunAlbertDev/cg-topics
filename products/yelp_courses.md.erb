### Yelp for Courses
* Complements "Rate my Professor"
* But its for courses
* Specifically for one campus

In the simplest example, simply let me list my 3 favorite courses. Or perhaps rate courses that I've taken. And then help another student discover great courses in other departments perhaps that they never knew existed. Generalize to help me pick my favorite beer, or my favorite tv show. Instead of ratings, keep it very simple: each user picks their top 3. Generalize further by tying in availability of the course, or whether it counts for your major, or whether it is offered when you need it.
