desc: Create stock selection agents
---
Approachable way to create stock selection agents which watch for certain patterns in prices and market conditions and do things, most likely send an email. For example: "Alert: Stock INTL price is within 10% of 12 month low." Allow a normal person to do program trading in a safe way. Possible to have some domain specific language, or an iTunes Smart Playlist kind of user interface to create agents that 'run in the cloud' and send emails, or some day actually perform trades.
