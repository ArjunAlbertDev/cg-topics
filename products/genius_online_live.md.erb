Inspired by an Amazon announcement today: [Amazon Mayday](http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/24/amazon-introduces-mayday-a-unique-and-amazingly-useful-live-tech-support-system-for-kindle/). This idea is to provide the same kind of "Apple Genius" live support to Mac and Windows users. They pay a subscription fee or a per incident fee and get live video assistance for their basic computer problems. I do this for my mother all the time. And by the way, if someone calls AppleCare to get help, the incident cost is pretty high. This could by concierge-tested very easily.
