title: Field Data
desc: Allow the collection of field data without needing a network
---
**Problem:** Need to collect data in the field without requiring connectivity. Let's say for research purposes you are visiting schools and letting students fill out a questionnaire of some kind. But there is no internet. And lets say you have amny researchers doing this at the same time. How to reconcile and keep the data correct and intact

**Approach**: Each data collector installs the app when they have connectivity to a server and select a database for which they are collecting data. Information is downloaded to the device at which time connectivity is no longer needed. 

Now the app is able to operate disconnected and present forms, allow the researcher to review, correct, and delete records all without reconnecting.

From time to time when there is connectivity the device connects the device to the net and the information is replicated and reconciled. The app now gets all the records collected by all users, including corrections.

***Notes**: 
1. The device can be a smartphone, a tablet or a computer of any kind.
1. Even though this app is totally decentralized it presents the best possible illusion of being connected. Replication, conflicts, etc are all handled in the most flexible and reasonable way.
1. There is an access control model to distinguish the rights of different users.
