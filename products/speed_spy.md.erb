## Speed Spy
A distributed way to address speeding or unsafe driving on public transportation. Running this app simply captures the location and speed of the vehicle. The app knows the official speed limits for busses, trains, trolleys and captures apparent violations. This data is collated on the server to be used for flagging dangerous drivers, or times of day, or parts of a route.
