title: ReadToMe - Audio Articles
---
* **Vision:** I wish I could get articles read to me similarly to how I listen to podcasts
* **Background:** There are so many articles that I want to read online, but I simply don't have time given my commute. I wish I could just listen to interesting articles in the same way I listen to podcasts. 
    * I know that apps like Pocket let you do this but is computer narrated, so it sounds weird. I would definitely pay a small monthly subscription to get access to the top articles from the New York Times, New Yorker, TechCrunch, etc. narrated to me. 
    * Conversely I would be willing to record articles in my voice for a fee.
