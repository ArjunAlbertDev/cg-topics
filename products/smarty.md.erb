* **Proposer**: Pito Salas

* **Product name**: Smarty
e 
* **Tweet length summary of project:** Fun collaborative intelligence test

* **Product Summary:** This is primarily a game for friendly competition. Its a mobile app that throws difficult questions at the user and builds up a non-scientific picture of the intelligence of members of the community.

* **Describe the customer(s):** Members of a community (e.g. a university) who have a domain of knowledge in common.

* **Notes**: There are a lot of ways to take this. Maybe the questions are standardized IQ test questions, maybe they are domain specific, maybe they are trivial persuit kind of things. Maybe players can provide questions. Maybe there are ask-a-friend options.
