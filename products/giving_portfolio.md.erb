title: Giving Portfolio
desc: Help me decide who to donate to
---
This app uses publicly available charity ratings databases to design a customized, personal portfolio of giving based on broad categories of causes, funds to be donated, and a time schedule. With this app the donor orders a customized report recommending varying donations to causes over time. For example, I want to support charities with less than 12% overhead, that focus internationally on education and homelessness, and I want to donate $1000 every quarter. This tool will send me an email every three months with specific and up to date recommendations.
