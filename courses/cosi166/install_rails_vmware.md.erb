## Disclaimer
* This is not a foolproof recipe, it's just a guide of the kinds of things you have to do.
* These instructions are for people who want to run Rails and are currently on a Windows computer.
* Prerequisites: You must have around 20Gig free, preferably on a solid state disk (SSD)

## Install VMWare

1. Install the appropriate version of VMWare. [Brandeis Software Store](https://e5.onthehub.com/WebStore/Welcome.aspx?ws=253068f1-0c11-df11-85a5-0030487d8897&vsro=8)
1. Download [Ubuntu Desktop 16.04 LTS](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop). Then use it to install a new VMWare virtual machine
1. Run the Ubuntu Virtual Machine via VMWare

## Install Rails with rbenv
You are installing into your Linux running on VMWare. So your environment for these commands will be the linux shell displayed inside the VMWare window.

Before you follow the instructions, notice the following:

1. Rbenv is a ruby utility which makes it easy to install ruby and update it in the future
1. Modify: `rbenv install 2.3.1` -> `rbenv install 2.4.1`
1. Modify: `rbenv global 2.3.1` -> `rbenv global 2.4.1`
1. When you enter `gem env home` you should see something very similar to what is shown in the instructions. If not there's a problem and you should talk to your TA.
1. Now follow these instructions: [How to install Rails, Ruby with Rbenv on Ubuntu](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-ruby-on-rails-with-rbenv-on-ubuntu-16-04)

When everything is installed correctly, you should be able to check the versions with the following commands:

<%= code_begin %>
which ruby
which gem
which rails
ruby -v # should say something around 2.6.6
gem -v # should say something around 2.6.5
rails -v # should say something around 6.
<%= code_end %>
