---
#### Final Deliverables and exam
* Yes, this year is different!
* Will be scheduled the same way as the mid-semester review
* 30 Minute zoom meeting with Pito and one of the TAs

##### What to put into LATTE
* Presentation Slides (Powerpoint or similar) (not a link)
* Final Report (PDF) (not a link)
* Link to your team GitHub dir
* Link to your app running on Heroku
* Brandeis Project Text File

##### About the zoom meeting
* All team members must be there
* It will be semi-formal
* Team does the presentation
* Team does the demo
* Here are some general <%= link_to_topic :cosi166b_presentation_tips %>
* Pito and TA will save questions to the end:
    * about the presentation
    * about the implementation
    * about how the work was divided
    * Look at the code too

##### About the presentation
* You will have around 10 minutes to present
* It is not required that every team member speak
* You should have powerpoint or similar slides
* This is more of a technical presentation, not a marketing or selling pitch

##### The presentation should clearly cover
* An opening slide
* The functionality:
    * What user problem your product is meant to address
    * Exactly what the product does currently and if you had more time
* The technical side
    * How does it work?
    * What the technical architecture of the product is
    * A diagram of the architecture
    * What parts of it were especially challenging
    * Which ones go beyond the minimum Ruby on Rails
    * Which gems or other outside libraries or services you used
* The non-coding parts
    * What your approach was for testing
    * How you approached dividing the work between the team members
    * What you are most proud of
    * Where can your product be improved or expanded?
* A closing slide

##### About the product demo
* Take around 5 minutes to demo your product. 
* By now, you should be able to demonstrate your product!
* You do need to work on a demo 'script'
* The best demo scripts tell a bit of a story where you try to 'hook' the listener with a scenario that they recognize

##### Markdown file describing the project,
* Just following these simpleinstructions: <%= link_to_topic :brandeisprojects_md %>.
* This will create the entry for your project in [BrandeisProjects](http://pitosalas.github.io/brandeisprojects/)
