#### Introduction
We want to see how far we can take the [iRobot Create](http://store.irobot.com/default/create-programmable-programmable-robot-irobot-create-2/RC65099.html?cgid=us&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIk4O-s5Da2AIVhrrACh22tgbAEAAYASAAEgLw1fD_BwE) + Laptop configuration. iRobot Create is basically a Roomba robotic cleaner designed for research and experimentation. We have interfaced it with a linux laptop and demonstrated basic functionality. We want to take this as far as it can go.

#### Research Question
1. **Can iRobot Create with a cheap laptop mounted on top be a reliable ROS based robot.**
1. **Can we attach two webcams and use [OpenCV](http://wiki.ros.org/vision_opencv) to create a depth camera (paralax)?**
1. **Can we use the depth camera data as a substitute for the Lidar?**
1. **Can we use the depth camera data with the navigation stack?**

#### Project: Roving Eyes

* Mount the laptop to the iRobot create. Tim will do the mechanical connection. Lets call that the onboard laptop
* Mount a web cam (or use the camera on the laptop if that works) on it
* Write ROS code to drive the IC around based on a simple (but not ugly) teleop program that would be running on another laptop running ROS, lets call that the pilot laptop.
* The teleop program should have commands as follows:
  * Camera On
  * Camera Off
  * Stop
  * Forward
  * Backward
  * Rotate Right
  * Rotate Left

* The camera on the onboard laptop should capture the video when its on, and have it display on the pilot laptop.

* The ROS program on the laptop should drive the robot according to the teleop but in addition respond to the bump sensors so that the driver cannot drive it into a person or wall

* The robot should blink and flash and beep (whatever the IC can do) as it drives around.

#### Advanced Steps

* Move the teleop to a wireless remote or a smart phone
* Mount a second camera (or two cameras) on the IC and get them to work as a depth camera
