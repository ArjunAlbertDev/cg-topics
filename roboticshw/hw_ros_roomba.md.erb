#### Roomba Homework

##### What to do
* The iRobot ROOMBA is a vaccum cleaner. It moves in straight lines in a room until it comes to a wall or obstacle. At this point it stops and rotates in place for some number of degrees. And then it takes off again until it hits another obstacle.
* You will be writing a ROS node to exhibit this behavior
* Decide on two teams of three people, however you like
* Initially write and test in simulation (using Gazebo)
* Then test in a live robot
* The challenge is first, just getting it to work

##### Project
* Write a new program which has a robot drive through an area surrounded by walls, and act something like a variation on a roomba. 
* It drives around until it comes close to an obstacle, rotates in place, and continues in a new direction.
* It's not immediately clear how much to rotate: should it rotate some amount each time or should the amount of rotation vary randomly? 
* You can elaborate this any way you like. 
* The challenge beyond just getting it to work, is to make sure it doesn't get stuck somewhere. See how robust you can make it
* 

##### Deliverables
* Source code for your solution, zipped up
* A pdf document explaining your solution in as much or as little detail as you like
* A short video demonstration of your solution, as if you were showing it to a friend.
