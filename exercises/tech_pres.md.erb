##### Tech Presentation Guidelines

* The topic will be decided upon between the teacher and the student(s)
* The presentations will require you to look into something and explain it in a technical way to the rest of us
* You will have 30 minutes, including questions, so plan accordingly

##### Feedback and assessment
* Learning how to assess a new technology quickly and effectively is a very important skill to work on. This is the life of a software engineer nowadays. Should I or should I not adopt Kubernetes? 
* Being able to give an interesting and clear technical presentation is also a very important ability to practice. For example many companies will ask you to do a quick technical presentation as part of the interview process!
* And of course Senior Honors Projects and PhDs all require an excellent presentation design and delivery.

##### What a great Tech Pres looks like

* **New Tech or Concept**: We really learn about a new technical or computer science concept, technique, package or library. While some of it may have been heard about before, we feel that we have gained fresh insights.
* **Specific Package or Paper:** The presentation is focused, and goes beyond high level concepts, and introduce at least one technology or package, or go in depth about at least one scholarly paper that is relevant
* **Applicable:** At the end the we feel ready to incorporate what we learned into their assignments or project. It was specific enough to be actionable. It is important to explain how it will relate or fit into nanoTwitter
* **Real:** The presentation includes real code examples that run and illlustrate the specifics. Code examples, or live coding are part of the presentation, as well as links to relevant resources: libraries, papers, blog posts, etc.
