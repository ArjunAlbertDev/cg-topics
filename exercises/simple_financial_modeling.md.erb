#### Let's work through a detailed example!

* Work in a group to think through this scenario
  * Company "MerchMachine", it's basically a marketing company
  * All sales are through a web site (ecommerce)
  * Manufactures and sells t-shirts and similar merchandise
  * You can decide what the selling price of the t-shirt is
  * With advertising expects to sell 10% more t-shirts each month
  * They think that about $1.00 in marketing expense will sell another t-shirt
  * You might think that a cheaper t-shirt will sell more per advertising dollar
  * All manufacture and shipping is outsourced
  * Each t-shirt costs $7 to manufacture and ship
  * The company Employs 3 people initially. 
  * You might decide that they should have more or fewer people
