	* There are many other possibilities
* Work with your team on the following
	1. Come up with many variants of pricing models as you can
	1. Try to come up with a classification of those models, in other words look for the patterns, for example: what is being charged for, what is free? who is paying, who is getting something for free, what costs are fixed and which ones are variable, and so on.
* Prepare to present the results. You will have to consider how many potential customers you will come across,
