#### Applying this to real sites

##### Split into groups 
* Split into groups, and each pick a different one from below without checking what it is. 
* You may need to make an account to really see it
* Make notes about what's good and/or bad about each one? 
* And, specifically refer to one of the principles we have discussed.
* Prepare to come up to the front of class and show your chosen site and give your comments

**Note: you need to create an account in some cases to get the real sense of the UI**
