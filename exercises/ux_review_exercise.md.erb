title: User Experience Site Review
---
#### User Experience Site Review

##### Purpose: 
* Practicing awareness of basic user interface and design best practices
* Practicing ability to articulate exactly what's wrong with a design (because until you can articulate it you can't fix it)

#### What I hope you learn

* By listening to the critiques of others you will gain insights in how to recognize and how to articulate these kinds of issues
* By thinking about it to prepare you will reinforce your own understanding of the best practices
* By seeing several different writer's conception of the best practices, you will learn that there is no one correct authority

##### Process 

* Split into teams, and each pick a different one from below without checking what it is.  (You may need to make an account to really see it)
* Make notes about what's good and/or bad about each one?  And, specifically refer to one of the principles we have discussed.
* Prepare to come up to the front of class and show your chosen site and give your comments (just use a sheet of paper to remember the points you want to make.)

**Note: you need to create an account in some cases to get the real sense of the UI**
