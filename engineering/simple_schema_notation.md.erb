<%= callout("NB", " This is a notation that I invented to allow it to be written in a text file. Its not SQL nor an actual Schema declaration any database would understand.") %>

### "Syntax"

* A simple text file
* Two sections, Tables: and Associations
* Tables section:
  * Table name
  * List of columns
  * datatype and name
* Associations
  * Table name -> Table name (is One to Many)
  * Table name <- Table name (is Many to One)
  * Table name <-> Table name (is Many to Many)
