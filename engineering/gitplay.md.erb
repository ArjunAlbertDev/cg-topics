title: Git Play
---
1. Everyone sign up to a free Github account
1. Make sure you know your github username and password
1. Watch Pito create `my-play-repo`
1. Give Pito your github name so I can add you to the colaborators
1. Locate the **HTTPS clone URL** (not the SSH url) for newly created Repo
1. Everyone clone this repo to your top `git clone https:\\xxxx`
1. Change to the directory that was created by git clone (`my-play-project`)
1. Run your text editor and create a file and put some text into it
1. Check the status of your repo (`git status`)
1. Add that new file to the staging area for git (`git add`)
1. Now with that one change, create a new git commit (`git commit`)
1. Your local copy of the repo now has one more commit than the server had
1. But notice that all your classmates are doing the same, so, there may already be some more commits on the server. So just to make sure, pull the state down of the repo which is on the server. (`git pull`)
1. Now push your repo (and all its commits) to the server (`git push`)
1. Double check what the state of your local repo is (`git status`)
1. Now locate a file that you didn't create, and make a change to it using your text editor.
1. Follow the same steps above to send that change up to the server
1. Continue to play and play and play
